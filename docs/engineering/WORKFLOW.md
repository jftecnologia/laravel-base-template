# Development Workflow

**Purpose**: Define the development workflow from starting work to opening pull requests.

---

## Development Environment

### Starting the Dev Server

```bash
composer dev
```

This starts **all services concurrently**: Laravel server, queue worker, Pail (log tailing), and Vite (frontend HMR).

Access at: `http://localhost:8000`

For SSR mode: `composer dev:ssr`

If frontend changes are not reflected in the UI, run `npm run build` or restart `npm run dev`.

### First-Time Setup

```bash
composer setup
```

This runs: `composer install` → copy `.env` → `key:generate` → `migrate` → `npm install` → `npm run build`.

---

## Pre-Commit Checklist

Before **any** commit:

```bash
# PHP quality (MANDATORY)
composer lint

# Frontend quality
npm run lint
npm run types
```

If tests exist for the changed area:

```bash
composer test
```

No commits are allowed without passing `composer lint`.

---

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- Always create a new branch — never commit directly to `master`
- Branch from `master` unless working on an existing feature branch

### Branch Naming

```
<type>/<short-description>

Types:
- feat/       → New feature
- fix/        → Bug fix
- refactor/   → Code refactoring (no behavior change)
- chore/      → Tooling, dependencies, config
- docs/       → Documentation only
- test/       → Test additions or fixes
```

Examples:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/user-notifications
git checkout -b fix/login-redirect
git checkout -b refactor/payment-service
```

---

## Commit Guidelines

### Semantic Commits

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body explaining what and why]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `style`, `perf`

Examples:

```
feat(auth): add two-factor authentication setup page

Implemented the 2FA configuration page using Fortify's TOTP support
with QR code display and recovery code management.
```

```
fix(notifications): prevent duplicate email on password reset
```

### Commit Rules

- **Atomic**: one logical change per commit
- **Complete**: the commit doesn't break the application
- **Descriptive**: clear what was changed and why
- **By activity, not by file**: `feat(auth): add login flow` not `update LoginController.php`

---

## Pull Request Workflow

### Before Opening a PR

**Ask the user first:**

> "Deseja que eu abra um Pull Request?"

Only open PRs when confirmed.

### PR Checklist

Before requesting review:

1. `composer lint` passes
2. `composer test` passes
3. `npm run lint` passes
4. `npm run types` passes
5. No `dd()`, `dump()`, `console.log()`, or debug code
6. No unused imports or TODOs without tickets
7. Documentation updated if needed

### PR Format

**Title**: `<type>: <short description>` (under 70 characters)

**Body**:

```markdown
## Summary
- What was done and why (2-3 bullet points)

## Test Plan
- [ ] How to verify the changes work

## AI-Assisted Development Workflow

### Using Claude Code Skills

The template includes skills for structured development:

1. **`/generate-prd`** — Define product requirements in `docs/PRD.md`
2. **`/generate-architecture`** — Create architecture docs in `docs/architecture/`
3. **`/generate-task-breakdown`** — Break requirements into tasks in `docs/tasks/`
4. **`/implement-task`** — Implement individual tasks with quality gates

### Using Laravel Boost (MCP)

Laravel Boost provides tools for AI-assisted development:

- `search-docs` — Search version-specific documentation (always use before coding)
- `list-artisan-commands` — Check available artisan commands and parameters before running them
- `tinker` — Execute PHP in application context (prefer tests over tinker for verification)
- `database-schema` — Inspect table structure before writing migrations or models
- `database-query` — Run read-only SQL queries
- `last-error` — Get last backend error/exception
- `browser-logs` — Read recent frontend console logs (old logs are stale)
- `list-routes` — List application routes
- `get-absolute-url` — Get correct URLs when sharing with user

#### search-docs Query Syntax

Use multiple broad queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting']`. Do not add package names to queries. Pass a `packages` array to filter results when targeting specific packages.

- Simple words with auto-stemming: `authentication` finds `authenticate` and `auth`
- Multiple words (AND): `rate limit` finds entries with both terms
- Quoted phrases: `"infinite scroll"` matches exact adjacent words
- Mixed: `middleware "rate limit"` combines AND + exact phrase
- Multiple queries: `["authentication", "middleware"]` matches ANY term
