# Code Standards & Conventions

**Purpose**: Define code quality standards, conventions, and development philosophy for this Laravel application.

---

## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **No DDD** — no aggregates, repositories, or domain layers
- **Low bureaucracy, high clarity**
- **Simplicity and explicitness over abstraction**
- **Configuration over hard-coding**
- **Plug-and-play mindset** — features should be easy to enable/disable

### Architecture Goals

Code must be: **Extensible**, **Pluggable**, **Testable**, **Maintainable**.

SOLID applied pragmatically — improve clarity, not add layers.

## Code Organization

### Where Things Go

| What                          | Where                          | Example                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Actions** (single-purpose)  | `app/Actions/<Domain>/`        | `app/Actions/Fortify/CreateNewUser.php` |
| **Services** (multi-step logic)| `app/Services/`               | `app/Services/PaymentService.php`    |
| **Enums**                     | `app/Enums/`                   | `app/Enums/LogLevel.php`            |
| **Extensions** (package customization) | `app/Extensions/<Package>/` | `app/Extensions/ActivityLog/Activity.php` |
| **Controllers**               | `app/Http/Controllers/`        | Grouped by domain in subfolders     |
| **Form Requests**             | `app/Http/Requests/`           | `app/Http/Requests/Settings/ProfileUpdateRequest.php` |
| **Middleware**                 | `app/Http/Middleware/`         | App-level only                       |
| **Models**                    | `app/Models/`                  | One model per file                   |
| **Providers**                 | `app/Providers/`               | Service providers                    |
| **Jobs**                      | `app/Jobs/`                    | Queued jobs                          |
| **Events / Listeners**        | `app/Events/`, `app/Listeners/`| Event-driven features               |
| **Notifications**             | `app/Notifications/`           | Email, SMS, database notifications  |
| **Policies**                  | `app/Policies/`                | Authorization policies              |
| **Helpers**                   | `app/Support/helpers.php`      | Global helper functions             |
| **Exceptions**                | Created via `php artisan make:app-exception` | Uses `jftecnologia/laravel-exceptions` |

### Actions vs Services

- **Action**: single purpose, one public method (`execute`). Use for discrete operations.
- **Service**: coordinates multiple steps or has multiple related methods. Use when logic requires orchestration.
- **Rule**: if it does one thing, it's an Action. If it coordinates, it's a Service.

### Extensions Directory

`app/Extensions/` is for **non-domain customizations** of installed packages:

```
app/Extensions/
├── ActivityLog/          # Spatie ActivityLog model overrides
├── LaravelContext/       # Custom context providers and middleware
├── LaravelExceptions/    # Custom exception channels
├── LaravelTracing/       # Custom tracing sources
└── System/               # System-level middleware (security headers, locale, etc.)
```

Never put business/domain logic here — only package integration customizations.

---

## PHP Standards

### Code Style

- **PSR-12** code style (enforced by Pint)
- **PSR-4** autoloading
- Always use curly braces for control structures, even single-line bodies
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion

### Type Declarations

Always use explicit types for parameters, return types, and properties:

```php
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    // ...
}
```

### Enums

- Keys in **TitleCase**: `FavoritePerson`, `Monthly`, `Active`
- Use backed enums (`string` or `int`) when persisting to database

### Naming Conventions

| Element   | Style         | Example                        |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Classes   | PascalCase    | `CreateNewUser`                |
| Methods   | camelCase     | `resolveFromRequest()`         |
| Variables | camelCase     | `$correlationId`               |
| Booleans  | is/has/can/should | `$isActive`, `hasPermission()` |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE   | `MAX_RETRIES`                  |

### PHPDoc

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments
- Add array shape type definitions when appropriate
- Never use inline comments unless logic is exceptionally complex

### Fluent APIs

Prefer fluent, expressive interfaces when designing classes:

```php
LaravelTracing::correlation()
    ->fromHeader('X-Correlation-Id')
    ->persistInSession()
    ->attachToResponse();
```

---

## Laravel Conventions

### Artisan Commands

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create files (migrations, controllers, models, etc.)
- For generic PHP classes, use `php artisan make:class`
- Always pass `--no-interaction` and the correct `--options` to artisan commands
- When creating models, also create factories and seeders — check available options via `php artisan make:model --help`

### Database & Eloquent

- Use Eloquent models and relationships — avoid `DB::` facade; prefer `Model::query()`
- Prevent N+1 queries with eager loading (`with()`)
- Laravel 12 supports limiting eager loaded records natively: `$query->latest()->limit(10)`
- Use relationship methods with return type hints
- Define casts in a `casts()` method (not `$casts` property) — follow existing model patterns
- Migrations must include all column attributes when modifying (Laravel 12 drops unspecified attributes)

### Controllers & Validation

- Always use Form Request classes for validation — never inline in controllers
- Check sibling Form Requests for array vs string rule format (follow existing convention)
- Group controllers in subfolders by domain: `Http/Controllers/Settings/`

### API Development

- Default to Eloquent API Resources with API versioning
- Follow existing API route conventions if they differ

### Authentication & Authorization

- Fortify handles headless auth (login, register, password reset, 2FA)
- Auth actions live in `app/Actions/Fortify/`
- Use gates and policies for authorization

### Configuration

- **Never use `env()` outside config files** — always `config('key')`
- Use environment variables only in `config/*.php`
- Package configurations go in `config/<package>.php`

### Queues & Jobs

- Use `ShouldQueue` interface for time-consuming operations
- Tracing context propagates automatically to queued jobs (via `laravel-tracing`)

### URL Generation

- Use named routes and `route()` function
- Frontend: import from `@/actions/` or `@/routes/` (Wayfinder)

### Internationalization (i18n)

- Use `__()` helper or `trans()` for all user-facing strings
- Translation files in `lang/` directory
- `lucascudo/laravel-pt-br-localization` provides pt-BR translations
- Design with i18n in mind — never hardcode user-facing text

---

## Frontend Standards

### TypeScript

- All frontend code in TypeScript — no plain `.js` files
- Use strict mode (`tsconfig.json`)
- Define shared types in `resources/js/types/`

### React Components

- Functional components only (no class components)
- Use hooks for state and effects
- Page components in `resources/js/pages/`
- Reusable components in `resources/js/components/`
- Layouts in `resources/js/layouts/`

### Inertia.js

- Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing (not Blade views)
- Page components live in `resources/js/pages/` (configurable via `vite.config.js`)
- Use deferred props with skeleton/pulsing loading states
- Always use `search-docs` for version-specific Inertia documentation
- See skill: `inertia-react-development` for patterns

### Wayfinder (Route Generation)

- Import from `@/actions/` (controllers) or `@/routes/` (named routes)
- Invokable controllers: `import StorePost from '@/actions/.../StorePostController'; StorePost()`
- Parameter binding detects route keys: `show({ slug: "my-post" })` for `{post:slug}`
- Query merging: `show(1, { mergeQuery: { page: 2, sort: null } })` — `null` removes params
- Inertia forms: use `.form()` with `<Form>` component or `form.submit(store())` with `useForm`
- See skill: `wayfinder-development` for patterns

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS v4 utilities — follow existing patterns before adding new ones
- Use `class-variance-authority` for component variants
- Use `tailwind-merge` + `clsx` for conditional classes
- Always use `search-docs` for version-specific Tailwind CSS documentation
- See skill: `tailwindcss-development` for patterns

## Quality Tools

### Running Quality Checks

```bash
# PHP
composer lint          # format + rector + analyze (MANDATORY before commits)
vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent  # During AI-assisted dev (run to fix, never --test)

# JavaScript
npm run lint           # ESLint with auto-fix
npm run format         # Prettier
npm run types          # TypeScript type checking
```

All checks must pass before committing.

### Static Analysis

- Larastan Level 5 — strict but pragmatic
- Avoid magic methods (`__call`, `__get`) that break analysis
- Use explicit types everywhere
- Prefer dependency injection over service locators

---

## Refactoring Rules

- Refactor only when implementing a related feature, fixing a bug in the area, or when explicitly requested
- Never refactor unrelated code or code that works and is clear
- Refactoring must be scoped and intentional — ask before structural changes

---

## Consistency Rules

Before implementing anything new:

1. Check sibling files for structure, approach, and naming
2. Check for existing components to reuse before writing new ones
3. Reuse existing patterns — prefer consistency over novelty
4. Do not introduce a new pattern if a similar one exists
5. Use descriptive names: `isRegisteredForDiscounts()`, not `discount()`

**Consistency beats cleverness.**
